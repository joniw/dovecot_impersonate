This package ships the dovecot-impersonate roundcube plugin to be used with
the kolab roundcube packages @ ITI.

The package is generated from a git repository and includes a patch to support
the use of the impersonation login data with authenticated SMTP; the patch
will be removed once upstream applies our patch.
